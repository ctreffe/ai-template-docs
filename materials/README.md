# Project Materials

Synchronized external materials use provider-neutral `sync:` roots and storage
`external`; see [SYNCHRONIZED_STORAGE.md](../SYNCHRONIZED_STORAGE.md).

`materials/` contains retained, assistant-readable working files created by the
documentation project or derived by changing content from external files under
`input/`. Git versioning and publication remain separate decisions.

Files under `input/` remain content-unchanged. Cropping, annotation, redaction,
OCR, conversion, optimization, combination or any other content change creates
a new material. Preserve the original input and record its ID under `Based on`
in `CATALOG.md`.

The catalog records three storage states:

- `local`: stored under `materials/local/` and ignored by Git;
- `versioned`: stored under `materials/versioned/` and approved for Git;
- `external`: stored outside the repository and represented by a stable
  logical location in the catalog.

Copy `PATHS.local.example.md` to the ignored `PATHS.local.md` for
device-specific paths. Never version credentials, private share tokens or
absolute local paths.

Examples include cropped screenshots, OCR extracts, converted reference
documents, retained review preparations, research reports and researched
JSON/CSV data. Research normally uses `materials/local/research/`; approved
versioned or external storage remains available. Use
[the report scaffold](../templates/RESEARCH_REPORT.md) to preserve question-level
findings, provenance and refresh rules. Document contexts assign catalog IDs to
one or more documents without copying shared files. Retained research remains
working evidence rather than automatically accepted document text.

Move accepted textual content to
`docs/`; keep reviewed binary documentation material in `materials/versioned/`
after Git approval and preserve its provenance. Presentation source belongs in
`styles/`. Generated review copies and finished publication outputs belong in
the applicable format directory below `output/`; returned annotated review
files remain separate under `review/`.

## Question research

Retain question research reports and optional datasets as separately cataloged
materials, normally under ignored `local/research/`. Use the
[report scaffold](../templates/RESEARCH_REPORT.md) for concrete questions,
individual source assessments with evidence/reasons/dates, methods and limits.
Keep prior report/source references when later assessments change. New data
retain schema and record/field provenance; publication remains separate.
