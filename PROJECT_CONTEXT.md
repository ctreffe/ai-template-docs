# Project Context

This file is a template. In a derived documentation project, replace the placeholders with project-specific context.

## Template lineage and initialization

- Repository role: derived project
- Source template: AI Documentation Template
- Initial template baseline: `<template version and commit hash>`
- Initialization status: `<not started | in progress | completed>`
- Initialization date: `<YYYY-MM-DD | not yet completed>`
- Last template harmonization: `<not yet performed | date and TEMPLATE_SYNC.md record>`
- Last collaboration retrospective: `<not yet performed | reviewed period or milestone, date and relevant record>`
- Intentional template deviations and relevant Decision Records: `<none | concise list>`

Keep `PROJECT_SETUP.md` as initialization provenance. It describes the
project's methodological roots; this section records its
initial lineage and lifecycle status. Later selective adoption belongs in
TEMPLATE_SYNC.md, not a second baseline history here.

During initialization, fill only the fields needed for the six fundamental
answers, the first useful document outcome and its current source boundary.
Leave later document, structure, media, feedback, render and publication detail
explicitly undecided until the corresponding workflow needs it.

## Relevant documents

- `PROJECT_SETUP.md` - retained initialization method and provenance
- `TASK_HANDOFF.md` - compact versioned task checkpoint
- `.agents/skills/` - automatic lifecycle and explicit specialized workflows
- `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` - conditionally loaded portable environment recovery patterns
- `SYNCHRONIZED_STORAGE.md` - provider-neutral external storage for large documentation files
- `$sync-template` - source-template comparison and selected adoption
- `$check-consistency` - internal documentation consistency diagnosis
- `$perform-retrospective` - structured documentation-collaboration review
- `DOCS_SETUP.md` - documentation setup and current model
- `DOCUMENTS.md` - compact maintained-document index and context paths
- `docs/<document-slug>/DOCUMENT_CONTEXT.md` - document contract, assigned evidence and assembly/update method, shared across language versions
- `templates/` - reusable document-context and research-report scaffolds
- `$investigate-question` - concrete practical questions, saved research reports and optional data materials
- `DOCUMENTATION_PROCESS.md` - ongoing documentation workflow
- `FEEDBACK_WORKFLOW.md` - direct-source, DOCX and PDF review workflow
- `AUDIENCE.md` - audience assumptions
- `STYLE_GUIDE.md` - documentation style
- `QUARTO.md` - source and render workflow
- `decisions/` - durable documentation, project or architecture decisions
- `input/` - unchanged external files and sources plus their catalog
- `temp/` - never-versioned intermediate files
- `materials/` - retained assistant-readable documentation files and catalog
- `styles/` - maintained presentation source when needed
- `output/` - ignored rendered or packaged outputs separated by format
- `review/` - ignored returned annotated review files

## Collaboration notes

- The maintainer owns structure, technical correctness, and publication.
- The assistant may provide feedback and consistency checks.
- Maintainer decisions and clarification questions should be presented as
  concise numbered lists when practical.
- Staging and unstaging require a specific maintainer request or authorization
  of the corresponding commit, but no control word. Protected Git actions
  require a specific instruction containing `explicit`, `explicitly` or the
  German word family `explizit`.

## Task continuation

Use [TASK_HANDOFF.md](TASK_HANDOFF.md) for the bounded task objective, exact
artifacts, pending checks, scope limits and next action. Update project context
only when intent, durable constraints or the current roadmap changes. Retain
domain-specific evidence/access limits in their authoritative sections above.
Protected Git actions and publication retain separate authorization.

## State ownership and template synchronization

| State | Authoritative owner |
| --- | --- |
| Project intent, constraints and current roadmap | PROJECT_CONTEXT.md |
| Current bounded task checkpoint and next task action | TASK_HANDOFF.md |
| Selected upstream comparison, adoption and deferred changes | [TEMPLATE_SYNC.md](TEMPLATE_SYNC.md), only when sync is selected |
| Durable rationale and completed history | Decision Records and CHANGELOG.md |

Keep the last-harmonization field above as a date/summary pointer to the sync
record, not a second adoption ledger. Task completion does not close unrelated
project or document work. Preserve context owned by another active objective.

DOCUMENTS.md owns document lifecycle; each shared DOCUMENT_CONTEXT.md owns its
assembly/update rules, assigned evidence and document-specific follow-ups.
TASK_HANDOFF.md links affected contexts without copying their backlogs.
