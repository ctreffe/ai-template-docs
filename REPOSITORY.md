# Repository Model

This repository follows a repository-first documentation workflow. Durable context, decisions, and documentation files should be versioned whenever they are part of the project record.

Use `start-task` for lean bounded entry and `TASK_HANDOFF.md` for current task
state. Invoke `$review-project` explicitly to reconcile comprehensive project,
documentation and read-only Git evidence.

## Expected structure

- `README.md`: Repository overview.
- `README.de.md`: German overview.
- `AGENTS.md`: Automatic AI-agent entry point.
- `COLLABORATION.md`: AI collaboration model.
- `PROJECT_SETUP.md`: Initialization workflow.
- `DOCS_SETUP.md`: Documentation setup checklist.
- `DOCUMENTS.md`: Compact document index, context/source paths and lifecycle.
- `docs/<document-slug>/DOCUMENT_CONTEXT.md`: Shared language-set contract,
  assigned evidence and repeatable assembly/update rules.
- `templates/`: Context and research-report scaffolds.
- `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`: Project-specific context template.
- `DOCUMENTATION_PROCESS.md`: Ongoing process.
- `AUDIENCE.md`: Audience model.
- `STYLE_GUIDE.md`: Documentation style guide.
- `SCREENSHOTS.md`: Screenshot policy.
- `LINKS.md`: Link and reference rules.
- `decisions/`: Decision Records, including DDRs, PDRs and ADRs.
- `CHANGELOG.md`: Version history.
- `VERSION`: Current template or project version.
- `_quarto.yml`: Quarto project configuration.
- `input/`: Intake and catalog for unchanged external files and sources.
- `docs/`: Maintained Quarto source files.
- `materials/versioned/`: Maintained binary documentation material approved
  for Git, including reviewed screenshots and figures.
- `styles/`: Maintained presentation source when needed.
- `output/`: Ignored generated outputs separated by format.
- `review/`: Ignored returned annotated review files.

## Project introductions and inherited workflow guides

New project initialization follows the four-file contract in `PROJECT_SETUP.md`:
`README.md` and `README.de.md` introduce the project; `TEMPLATE_README.md` and
`TEMPLATE_README.de.md` retain adapted workflow and skill guidance. Both language
pairs are required and link to one another by role and language. Project README
badge policy applies to the project pair; retained guides omit inherited badges.
Keep guides aligned with actual retained files and skills and local accepted
rules. Selected upstream README updates map to the guides through `sync-template`
without replacing the project introductions. Source maintenance checkouts retain
their own README pair; the extra files exist only after project initialization.

## README badge policy

Use a compact badge block directly below the README title and before the AI
Collaboration Note. The standard order is status, version and license, followed
only by badges for real documentation automation such as a site build or link
check.

Status links to `VERSION`, version links to `CHANGELOG.md` and license links to
`LICENSE`. Public templates may use dynamic GitHub metadata. Avoid a
last-commit badge because activity does not establish documentation quality or
publication readiness.

Derived documentation projects adapt the badges to their own documented
status, completed version, actual license and available workflows. They must
not retain the Documentation Template version as their project version or show
automation that does not exist. English and German badge blocks remain
identical for the required project README pair; retained guides omit inherited badges.

## External files, maintained documentation and outputs

Use `input/intake/`, `input/restricted/`, `input/local/` and
`input/versioned/` to classify external screenshots, logs, exports, tickets,
source documents and operational data. Record safe provenance and handling
status in `input/CATALOG.md`; use the ignored `input/CATALOG.local.md` for
sensitive names, paths or details.

Maintained Quarto and Markdown sources belong in `docs/`, approved versioned
binary documentation material in `materials/versioned/`, presentation source
in `styles/`, and returned annotated review files in `review/`. Generated HTML,
PDF, DOCX and other results belong below ignored `output/` in a directory named
for their format. Moving an approved file into a maintained location records
its Git and project role but does not grant publication rights.

Normally group each maintained document and its language versions/chapters in
`docs/<document-slug>/`, with a shared internal `DOCUMENT_CONTEXT.md`. The
context preserves its contract, assigned catalog IDs and assembly/update rules;
`DOCUMENTS.md` indexes it. Keep contexts out of publication resources. Research
reports and generated datasets are retained materials, not reader documents.

Assistant access, Git versioning and publication or other sharing are separate
decisions. Before preparing a commit, review new and untracked files for
personal data, internal system details, secrets, confidential information,
licensing restrictions and unredacted visuals.

Rendered pages, screenshots, tables, interactive elements, embedded resources,
archives and file metadata may disclose sensitive information even when raw
sources are absent. Review them before versioning or publication. Automated
checks may identify risks, but a clean result does not authorize access,
versioning or publication.

## Temporary working files

`temp/` is fully ignored and never versioned. All contents outside
`temp/restricted/` are assistant-readable disposable documentation intermediates; assistants must not
enumerate or read `temp/restricted/`. Promote retained files to `materials/`.

## Project materials

Keep `input/` content unchanged. Store retained OCR text, transformed
screenshots, converted references and other working foundations in
`materials/`, with provenance and `local`, `versioned` or `external` storage
recorded in `materials/CATALOG.md`. Every registered material is
assistant-readable, but versioning and publication remain separate decisions.
Move accepted textual content to `docs/`. Move reviewed binary documentation
material to `materials/versioned/` only after Git versioning is approved; keep
presentation source in `styles/`. Publication remains a separate decision.

## Git workflow

Use small, reviewable changes. Keep unrelated work out of the same commit.

Every commit should include a concise summary and a meaningful description that
matches the actual diff. Regular commits use an exact direct prefix such as
`docs:`, `feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `refactor:` or `test:` and represent one
logical documentation step. Do not use scoped forms such as `docs(site):`.
Use real line breaks in the description and never literal `\n` escape text.

A milestone should normally be built through multiple regular commits when
structure, drafting, review and correction can be separated meaningfully.
Milestone commits should omit the prefix, be descriptive, include the completed
version number and primarily close already reviewed work. They must not hide
unreviewed content or bundle a whole separable milestone into one change.

Staging and unstaging are index operations and do not require a control word.
They require a specific maintainer request or authorization of the corresponding
commit, and existing staged selections and unrelated changes must be preserved.

The assistant must not commit, amend, tag, push, pull, merge, rebase, reset,
switch branches, manipulate stashes, rewrite history or perform another
protected Git action unless the maintainer instruction for that specific action
contains a recognized control word: `explicit` or `explicitly` in English, or
the German word family `explizit`, including `explizite`, `expliziten`,
`expliziter` and `explizites`.

Within `commit-changes`, repository-specific explicit commit authorization
includes the normal push to the verified existing upstream unless excluded.
Within `commit-milestone`, explicit milestone commit authorization also includes
one matching annotated version tag and its exact upstream push (TVDR-0053).
"Commit only" excludes tags and pushes; "no push" retains a local commit/tag;
"no tag" excludes tag creation/push; "no tag push" retains the local tag.
Skill invocation alone grants no Git authority. Force-push, other refs, remote
changes, tag movement/replacement and release publication remain separately
controlled. This changes neither content-access nor publication rules.
