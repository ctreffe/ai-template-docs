# Project Setup

Use this file when creating a concrete documentation project from the template.

Keep `PROJECT_SETUP.md` in derived projects as documentation of the
initialization method. Record completion, source-template baseline and later
harmonizations in `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`; remove it
only as a deliberate, documented maintainer exception.

## Project READMEs and retained template guides

Initialization creates four required root documents. Keep `README.md` and
`README.de.md` as the English project introduction and its close German
translation. Retain the inherited operating guidance in `TEMPLATE_README.md`
and `TEMPLATE_README.de.md`, adapted for the initialized project. Source-template
maintenance checkouts keep their original README pair; do not initialize them
or add duplicate guide files.

After the fundamentals and applicable access gates are settled, inspect all
four paths before changing inherited README content. Rename each confirmed
inherited README to its corresponding `TEMPLATE_README*` path without overwrite,
then create the project pair. Preserve existing changes. For interrupted setup,
verify which files are inherited guides and which are project introductions,
continue only the missing work and never rename a project introduction into a
guide. Resume adaptation of a verified partial guide while preserving unrelated
edits; do not replace it with another inherited README. Stop conflicting file
replacements for bounded resolution; do not delete or overwrite unknown content.
If an inherited language is missing, translate verified authorized content and
report the evidence limit;
do not invent an upstream baseline. Keep incomplete setup visibly pending.

The project pair explains purpose, audience, current state, setup or use and
relevant project files. Link early to the corresponding guide under
"Workflows and Skills" / "Workflows und Skills". Keep the AI Collaboration Note
near the top, project-specific identity and truthful badges where applicable,
and the actual license reference at the bottom. Do not duplicate the full skill
catalog or claim planned functionality already exists.

Adapt the retained guide rather than treating it as an immutable archive:

- Give it a guide title, a factually correct AI Collaboration Note and a short
  origin explanation linking to `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` for source-template
  version, commit and synchronization baseline. Link back to the corresponding
  project introduction. Local `AGENTS.md`, domain rules and accepted project
  decisions remain authoritative; the guide is operating documentation.
- Preserve workflow and domain guidance. Remove or reframe source-maintenance,
  repository-creation and completed one-time initialization instructions so
  they are not presented as ongoing project tasks.
- Align skill catalogs, file descriptions and contents with the final retained
  inventory. Remove local links to deleted files or skills, including
  `create-local-project` and template-only `IDEAS.md`. Source-only capabilities
  may be explained without implying local availability. Retain a deliberately
  established project backlog. Retired source-template creation workflows
  must not be retained as current project skills.
- Remove inherited status, version, license and automation badges from both
  guides; their local targets would otherwise describe the project as the
  template. Preserve required attribution and license notices. Distinguish
  source provenance from the actual project rights in the closing license
  section without changing licensing or requiring private upstream access.
- Keep all four files at the root. Use reciprocal language links within each
  pair, repair links and contents after adaptation, and review both pairs for
  close structural and semantic translation. Project badge blocks match across
  languages; guides have no inherited badge blocks.

Before declaring initialization successful, review all four files, their
language and project/guide navigation, current skill/file links, identity,
badges, license wording and domain safeguards against the final cleanup plan.
After authorized successful cleanup, verify that navigation matches the actual
remaining inventory. If this fails, report initialization as incomplete rather
than claiming a usable four-file result. `sync-template` maps later upstream
README changes to the retained guides, preserving project adaptations and the
project introductions. Existing active projects require separately selected
adoption; this contract does not reinitialize them.

## Lean initialization contract

Before the normal questionnaire, `$start-project` asks one concise,
unnumbered routing choice: use the normal lean path or explicitly select
`$grill-me` for detailed initialization and planning. The routing choice is
not one of the six project questions. The skill is never invoked from a
suggestion; a suggestion is not consent. The maintainer may decline or stop
grilling and return to the lean path, and neither path changes any access,
versioning, transmission, publication or protected-action authority.

`$start-project` begins with no more than six fundamental maintainer
questions. Each numbered item is one coherent decision, not a container for a
hidden questionnaire:

1. What is the documentation project's identity and purpose?
2. Who is the primary audience, and what should it be able to do?
3. What is the first useful document outcome, and what minimum evidence will
   show that it serves the audience?
4. What is currently in scope, and what are the explicit non-goals?
5. Which sources or materials may the assistant access now, and which
   sensitivity boundary applies?
6. Which delivery or operating constraint must be fixed before authoring
   begins?

Use repository evidence for answers already established. The last question
includes only a constraint that is consequential now; do not bundle structure,
screenshots, links, feedback, formats, rendering, storage and publication into
one survey. Keep safe template defaults for nonessential choices or mark them
explicitly undecided. Create only the initial document contract needed for the
first outcome; clarify later documents and detailed production choices through
their concrete workflows. Source access, transmission, publication and visual
approval remain separate gates when triggered.

## Initialization checklist

The checklist below guides implementation after the lean questionnaire. It is
not an instruction to ask every item during the initial maintainer turn.

1. Confirm repository identity.
   - Project name.
   - Repository URL.
   - Maintainer.
   - License model.

2. Confirm documentation type.
   - User guide, admin guide, technical concept, API reference, migration guide, troubleshooting guide, release documentation, operating procedure, or mixed documentation set.

3. Confirm documentation scope.
   - What is included.
   - What is out of scope.
   - What existing material should be reused.

4. Confirm audience.
   - Primary users.
   - Technical background.
   - Tasks they need to perform.
   - Risks the documentation should prevent.

5. Confirm source and sensitivity model.
   - Raw screenshots, logs, exports, tickets, URLs, configuration files, or source documents.
   - Sensitive or personal information.
   - Sanitization or redaction requirements.
   - Which raw sources or reviewed derivatives the assistant may inspect.
   - Which reviewed derivatives and generated outputs may be versioned.
   - Which files may be published or otherwise shared.
   - Which `.gitignore` rules must exist before source files are added to the
     working tree.
   - Which automated checks may warn about disclosure risks without being
     treated as safety approval.

6. Confirm visual documentation model.
   - Screenshot policy.
   - Diagram policy.
   - Naming and storage rules.
   - Visual-inspection expectations. Routine renders receive technical output
     validation without the Browser skill. Agent inspection occurs only
     through an explicitly invoked `$visual-inspection` for named current
     renders and maintainer-selected formats.

7. Confirm the external-file and project-material model.
   - Keep external content in `input/` unchanged.
   - Catalog retained created or transformed working files in `materials/`.
   - Treat registered materials as assistant-readable and decide local,
     versioned or external storage separately from publication.
   - Preserve provenance when moving accepted text to `docs/` or approving
     maintained binary documentation material for `materials/versioned/`.
   - Use ignored `temp/` for disposable, never-versioned intermediates and
     `temp/restricted/` when assistants must not inspect them.

8. Confirm link model.
   - Internal navigation.
   - External references.
   - Link checking expectations.
   - Stable source references.

9. Confirm feedback model.
   - Direct source comments, DOCX comments and Track Changes, annotated PDF or
     project-specific alternatives.
   - Explicit page, chapter, bundle or snapshot scope for generated review
     files.
   - Maintainer curation of external feedback, by default with `Maintainer:`
     comments.
   - Local storage, assistant access, Git versioning and publication rules for
     review files.
   - Generated review outputs below `output/<format>/` and returned annotated
     files directly below ignored `review/`.
   - Transfer of accepted feedback back to authoritative source files.

10. Adapt template files.
   - Create and review the four required README files under the contract above.
   - Retain and adapt `AGENTS.md` as the automatic agent entry point.
   - Preserve an AI Collaboration Note directly below the README title and badges, if badges are present.
   - Keep the note visible, factually correct for the derived project, and linked to `COLLABORATION.md`.
   - Include one concrete sentence describing what the collaboration model documents for the derived documentation project, such as documentation practices, collaboration workflows, link discipline, visual inspection or repository conventions.
   - Update `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`.
   - Complete `DOCS_SETUP.md`.
   - Complete the initial index entry in `DOCUMENTS.md` and create its shared
     `docs/<document-slug>/DOCUMENT_CONTEXT.md` from
     `templates/DOCUMENT_CONTEXT.md`. Put the local contract there; link reviewed
     project defaults rather than duplicating them. Keep linked language
     versions and chapters together, adapting navigation and relative links.
     Preserve assembly/update rules and assigned evidence as work proceeds;
     defer nonessential details rather than expanding the six-question entry.
     Keep the internal context outside rendered pages and resource bundles.
   - Adapt `FEEDBACK_WORKFLOW.md`, `AUDIENCE.md`, `STYLE_GUIDE.md`,
     `SCREENSHOTS.md` and `LINKS.md`.
   - Keep `PROJECT_SETUP.md` as initialization provenance.
   - Record the initial template version and commit, initialization status,
     later harmonization baseline and intentional deviations in
     `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`.

11. Establish the initial roadmap and review rhythm.
   - Define the first meaningful documentation milestone and its validation or
     publication objective.
   - Identify the next small structure, drafting, review and QA steps.
   - Plan regular Conventional Commits below the milestone and a separate
     milestone closure commit.

12. Confirm initialization completion.
   - Verify that the six fundamentals, first useful document contract, current
     source boundary, safe defaults and retained template state are documented
     consistently.
   - Nonessential roadmap, Quarto, feedback, publication, QA and later-document
     fields may remain explicitly undecided. Resolve a `TBD` only before the
     concrete drafting, source, render or publication work it governs.

13. Prepare initialization commit.
   - Review git status.
   - Review generated changes.
   - Normally use a regular `chore:` commit for initialization.
   - Use an unprefixed milestone commit only when initialization also completes
     a genuinely defined and reviewed versioned milestone.

## README badge policy

Place the badge block directly below the README title and before the AI
Collaboration Note. Use status, version and license in that order, followed
only by badges for real build, test or documentation automation.

Derived documentation projects must adapt the template badges to the concrete
project. Status must have a documented meaning, version must represent the
latest completed documentation state and license must match the repository.
Use release, site-build or link-check badges only when the corresponding
workflow exists. Avoid a last-commit badge because repository activity is not
documentation quality or publication readiness.

Keep English and German project README badge blocks identical. Retained
template guides omit inherited badge blocks.
Record the Documentation Template version and commit in `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`,
not as the derived project's version badge.

After successful initialization, replace the inherited source-template
maintenance history in `CHANGELOG.md` with a project-owned changelog beginning
at `Unreleased`. Replace `TASK_HANDOFF.md` with a project-owned initialization
handoff containing only current documentation-project state, decisions, checks
and the next step. Preserve template lineage in `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`, not in
either active project-history file. If initialization is incomplete, leave
both resets pending and identify the inherited content as non-authoritative.

After initialization, retain the repository skills and `TASK_HANDOFF.md`.
Routine tasks use `start-task`; invoke `$review-project`, `$sync-template`,
`$check-consistency`, `$add-document`, `$revise-document` and
`$perform-retrospective` explicitly only when their specialized outcome is
needed. Remove the project copy of `$create-local-project` after successful
initialization.

## Synchronized external storage

If large screenshots, recordings, video, audio, exports or reference files must
be available on several devices without entering Git, apply
`SYNCHRONIZED_STORAGE.md`. Decide provider transmission, stable project ID,
input and material scope, optional external outputs, availability checks,
conflict handling and backup. Create ignored `sync:` mappings on every device,
keep maintained `docs/`, approved `materials/versioned/` files and presentation
source in `styles/` authoritative, and do not synchronize `temp/`.

## Required local runtime setup

During initialization, check only what the first concrete outcome needs.
Reuse established answers; defer later tooling and do not add a mandatory
questionnaire. General optimization has no dedicated skill; concrete recurring
environment problems route through `reuse-fixes`.

Check the runtime needed for the selected outcome and the actual interpreter
used by its commands. A new clone/device does not inherit ignored environments;
missing local setup is not evidence of damage. Reuse the project's established
manager and isolation model. When Python is required and no suitable managed
environment exists, prepare a clone-local ignored .venv; do not create one for
a project without Python needs or copy one from another clone.

Track dependencies and lockfiles using existing project conventions (for
example requirements-tools.txt for Python helpers). Document reproducible setup
and explicit interpreter or manager commands. Prepare only needed local setup,
reuse existing approval and obtain any missing installation/download authority
before applying it. Verify the interpreter and a minimal relevant import or
original command; defer optional tools without blocking unrelated work.

Check Python only for required documentation helpers; Quarto use alone does not
require a new Python environment. Use non-sensitive synthetic verification.

## Reuse supplied setup choices

Reuse an already explicit lean/grilling selection; ask the routing question only
when no choice was supplied. A known approved storage mapping needs no new
setup questionnaire. New external areas use the simple layout in
[SYNCHRONIZED_STORAGE.md](SYNCHRONIZED_STORAGE.md). Existing mappings and files
are not migrated. [TEMPLATE_SYNC.md](TEMPLATE_SYNC.md) is used later for selected
upstream adoption, not as another initialization questionnaire.
