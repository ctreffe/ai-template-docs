# Documentation Setup

Use this checklist to define the documentation project before substantive drafting begins.

## Documentation identity

- Documentation title: TBD
- Documentation type: TBD
- Product, system, process, or topic covered: TBD
- Intended publication context: TBD
- Maintainer-approved status model: draft, review, stable, archived, or other.

## Documentation type

Select one or more and record the selected profile in `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`. Use `DOCUMENTATION_TYPE_PROFILES.md` for profile-specific structure and QA guidance. If the project is a tutorial, define the starting point, goal, reader task, expected result, and verification standard before drafting.

Select one or more:

- User guide.
- Admin guide.
- Developer documentation.
- API reference.
- Technical concept.
- Architecture documentation.
- Migration guide.
- Troubleshooting guide.
- Operating procedure.
- Release documentation.
- Training or onboarding material.
- Mixed documentation set.

## Audience

Audience definition is a first-order documentation decision, especially for tutorials and guides for less experienced users. Define the audience before deciding detail level, screenshots, terminology, or procedure depth.

Define:

- Primary audience.
- Secondary audience.
- Required prior knowledge.
- Tasks the documentation must support.
- Decisions the documentation must enable.
- Misunderstandings the documentation must prevent.

## Source material

Identify:

- Existing documentation.
- Source repositories.
- Tickets or issue threads.
- Screenshots or recordings.
- Logs, exports, or configuration examples.
- External references.

Before the assistant reads raw material, check whether it may contain sensitive information.

## Visual material

Decide:

- When screenshots are necessary.
- Which screen states must be captured.
- Whether screenshots need redaction.
- Whether diagrams are needed.
- Where maintained binary visual material and presentation source should live.
- Which current renders and formats may be selected for explicit
  `$visual-inspection`, and which project-specific criteria apply.

## Link model

Decide:

- Internal navigation conventions.
- External reference conventions.
- Link text standards.
- Link check cadence.
- Handling of private or unstable URLs.

## Language model

Define:

- Primary working language.
- Publication languages.
- Whether German and English are maintained in parallel. The default is parallel files, for example `topic.qmd` and `topic.de.qmd`.
- Whether one language is authoritative.
- How terminology and screenshots are checked across languages.

## Quarto model

Define:

- Whether Quarto is used as the internal source format.
- Whether the project is a website, single document, book, or mixed Quarto project.
- Required output formats, usually HTML and/or PDF.
- Format-specific generated-output directories below ignored `output/`, such
  as `output/html/`, `output/pdf/` or `output/docx/`.
- Whether `docs/index.qmd` and `docs/index.de.qmd` remain parallel entry points. This is the default bilingual structure.
- Required Quarto CLI installation and PATH status.
- Required R, Python, LaTeX, TinyTeX, or Quarto extensions. If PDF output is required, confirm TeX/TinyTeX during setup.
- Whether `quarto render` should be part of milestone QA.

## Feedback model

Define the review model according to `FEEDBACK_WORKFLOW.md`:

- Expected feedback channels: direct source review, annotated DOCX, annotated
  PDF, or a project-specific alternative.
- Which pages, chapters, selected bundles or named snapshots may be exported
  for review. Do not leave the scope of a website DOCX review implicit.
- Whether DOCX comments and Track Changes are expected for content review.
- Whether annotated PDFs are expected for layout, table, figure or print QA.
- How external feedback will be curated by the maintainer, including whether
  `Maintainer:` comments will be used.
- Which generated review outputs belong below `output/<format>/` and which
  returned annotated files belong directly below `review/`.
- Which review files the assistant may inspect, which may be versioned and
  which may be published or shared.
- How review decisions and closed feedback will be traced.

## Initial output

Before the first substantive documentation milestone, the repository should contain:

- Completed `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`.
- Completed initial entry in `DOCUMENTS.md` and shared document context from
  `templates/DOCUMENT_CONTEXT.md` under `docs/<document-slug>/`.
- Assembly/update rules, assigned source IDs and evidence baseline recorded
  as they become known; unresolved nonessential details explicitly deferred.
- Selected documentation type profile and language model.
- Confirmed Quarto model and output formats.
- Confirmed feedback channels, file scope and review-handling rules.
- Adapted audience, style, screenshot, link and visual-inspection rules.
- Initial documentation structure.
- Any required DDRs.
- Updated changelog and version information if a milestone is reached.
