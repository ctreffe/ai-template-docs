# Documentation Collaboration Contract

This provider-neutral contract defines maintainer–assistant collaboration in
documentation projects. `AGENTS.md` is the resident safety kernel; specialized
skills and domain files define rendering, revision and review methods.

## Roles and Authority

The maintainer owns documentation intent, audience, information architecture,
technical truth, disclosure and publication. The assistant organizes evidence,
drafts and revises maintained sources, checks consistency and reports what was
and was not validated. It must not invent product behavior, approval or
publication readiness.

Maintained repository sources are authoritative. Rendered HTML, PDF or DOCX and
returned annotations are evidence and review artifacts, not substitute sources.
Transfer accepted feedback deliberately and preserve a traceable source change.

## Documentation Partnership

Establish documentation type and audience before restructuring content. Keep
navigation, links, terminology, visuals and bilingual structure coherent.
Distinguish technical output inspection from visual inspection: rendering
proves only that generation succeeded. Inspect a rendered surface only through
an explicitly invoked `$visual-inspection` and within its selected scope.

Treat screenshots, logs, exports, tickets and operational examples as
potentially sensitive. Use the least revealing evidence that still supports the
documentation and keep publication approval separate from repository access or
versioning. Record durable documentation or workflow decisions with the local
Decision Record convention.

Within `commit-changes`, repository-specific explicit commit authorization
includes the normal push to the verified existing upstream unless excluded.
Within `commit-milestone`, explicit milestone commit authorization also includes
one matching annotated version tag and its exact upstream push (TVDR-0053).
"Commit only" excludes tags and pushes; "no push" retains a local commit/tag;
"no tag" excludes tag creation/push; "no tag push" retains the local tag.
Skill invocation alone grants no Git authority. Force-push, other refs, remote
changes, tag movement/replacement and release publication remain separately
controlled. This changes neither content-access nor publication rules.

When an applicable repository rule requires a control word, accompany the
request with one minimal copy-ready suggested instruction naming the exact
action, repository or destination and any publication, disclosure or other
material consequence. Only matching user-originated wording grants authority;
keep independent actions separate and never request standing authority.

## Context and Handoff

Use one task for one coherent documentation objective. Load only the relevant
audience, type, style, link, screenshot, feedback or Quarto guidance. Load
visual-inspection guidance only after explicit invocation.
Use `DOCUMENTS.md` to locate the document's shared `DOCUMENT_CONTEXT.md`, which
owns its contract, assigned evidence and repeatable assembly/update rules.
Consult it before document changes and retain accepted changes to those rules
or evidence baselines there. Linked language versions share one context.
Invoke `$investigate-question` deliberately by name for bounded practical
research with a saved report; frame concrete questions before searching.
Invoke `$add-document`
explicitly when an initialized project gains a maintained document; it must not
reopen project initialization or silently replace project-wide decisions.
For annotated review, invoke `revise-document`; invoke `render-document`
explicitly for a requested artifact or when necessary evidence is accepted as
part of the task. A compact versioned `TASK_HANDOFF.md`
preserves accepted decisions, exact sources, generated evidence, checks and the
next action across context or device changes.

## Task Effort and Communication

Keep the maintainer's configured reasoning baseline for ordinary work. Recommend
higher effort when unresolved competing constraints, difficult diagnosis or
consequential design or methodological uncertainty would benefit from deeper
analysis; name the decision it would help resolve. A large task alone is not a
reason to escalate. Lower effort may suit well specified routine edits. State
whether the current interface can change the setting; never imply a switch that
was not made.

When the user or applicable instructions authorize delegation, use a bounded
subtask with relevant authorized inputs, explicit model/effort where supported,
a compact result and no further delegation unless authorized. The primary
assesses the result and retains responsibility. Prefer one focused reviewer
over a standing orchestration loop. Include child usage in cost comparisons;
otherwise state that total usage is unobservable.

Keep progress updates useful and completion reports concise: outcome, obtained
evidence and material limits, without replaying routine logs.

## Validation Stages

A bounded edit needs only enough source, meaning and local-structure review to
be acceptable. An ordinary commit needs targeted evidence for a good,
reviewable document state. A milestone owns comprehensive applicable links,
bilingual alignment, rendering, disclosure and release evidence. Do not render
every format or run whitespace scans merely because maintained text changed;
render when the artifact is requested, necessary to assess the change or part
of milestone closure. Visual inspection remains separately explicit.

## Completion

For a clear access, authorization or setup failure, or a recurring execution
mistake, use `reuse-fixes` to consult this repository's confirmed experience
before repeating the failed approach. Apply an authorized correction, verify
it at the original checkpoint and retain concise prevention. Ask only for
missing authority or a material decision; there is no mandatory route-choice
menu. Keep experience repository-local and host facts in the ignored local
record. Do not collect or transfer lessons between repositories. All existing
access, security, installation, Git and publication boundaries remain in force.

Documentation is ready for review when maintained sources reflect verified
technical evidence, audience and structure are coherent, links and affected
formats are checked, disclosure risks are reported and generated artifacts are
clearly distinguished from sources. A successful render alone is insufficient.
